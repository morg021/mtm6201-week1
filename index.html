           Haven studied Communication Technolgy, I decided to dive indept into coding. I upted for Interactive Media Design 
           because it cuts accross all areas of rich Media production which includes but not limited to web development, video 
           production and graphic design. I am a charismatic personality and an African descent who loves Football, also called 
           Soccer in North America. My favorite subject is Physics. This subject deals with the physical and biological environment 
           around us. How it's being governed my laws.
         </p>
         <p> I love travelling, and have been to over thirty contries and territories. One common thing I learnt in exploring  these
            countries is rapid decline in Natural resources like trees, access to portable water, clean air and obviously our oceans
            are polluted.
